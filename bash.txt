Bash Features
*************

This text is a brief description of the features that are present in
the Bash shell (version 3.2, 28 September 2006).

   This is Edition 3.2, last updated 28 September 2006, of `The GNU
Bash Reference Manual', for `Bash', Version 3.2.

   Bash contains features that appear in other popular shells, and some
features that only appear in Bash.  Some of the shells that Bash has
borrowed concepts from are the Bourne Shell (`sh'), the Korn Shell
(`ksh'), and the C-shell (`csh' and its successor, `tcsh'). The
following menu breaks the features up into categories based upon which
one of these other shells inspired the feature.

   This manual is meant as a brief introduction to features found in
Bash.  The Bash manual page should be used as the definitive reference
on shell behavior.
